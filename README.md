# Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
A deep look into Machine Learning topics such as, Gradient Descent, Mean Square Error (MSE), Linear Regression, etc. As well as the math that is behind it implemented with Python


Steps to complete this:
  1. Create a two variable data set of things that can be correlated together
       Example: How does the number of hours spent studying affect test scores? Hours Studied (x) vs Exam Scores (y)
```
     sample_data = {
    "Time Studying (hours)": [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15],
    "Exam Grades (%)": [23, 30, 54, 62, 76, 81, 87,95,99, 100]
}
```
  3. Save the data into a CSV file
  4.
